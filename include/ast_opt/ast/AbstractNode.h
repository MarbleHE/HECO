/// DIRECTED GRAPH:
/// Nodes form a directed graph, with one end of each edge being the parent and the other being the child.
/// Nodes have exactly one pointer to their parent. If null, we say the node does not have a parent.
/// Nodes might have an arbitrary number of children, including none.
/// Some derived classes have a fixed number of children, while this changes dynamically for others.
/// Interaction with children should primarily happen via derived classes' specific getter/setter methods.
/// However, it is also possible to iterate over the children of any node with a NodeIterator
/// The order of the children is up to the derived class.
/// Note that some derived classes might internally use nullptr to represent "empty slots"
/// (e.g. deleted stmts in a Block, or an empty else-stmt in an If stmt)
/// If a child is null, we say it does not exist and it is not exposed externally.
///
/// LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:
/// A node owns its children and its children are deleted when the node itself is deleted.
/// Derived classes MUST implement this behavior, for example by using std::unique_ptr<>
/// Note that the parent is a raw pointer, however the above semantics should exclude dangling parent pointers.
/// Deleting a node will invalidate all iterators over this node and its children.
///
/// Changing Ownership of a Node (e.g. when moving a node around in a tree)
/// should proceed by first taking ownership to the local scope via takeNode()
/// Then, adding the node to its new parent via a derived class's setter method
/// Internally, the setter should first add the child and then use setParent()
